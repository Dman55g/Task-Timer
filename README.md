## Description:

Task:Timer is a Chrome extension that helps with better time management. The extension allows you to set 2 consecutive timers. The first timer is the work timer, and the second timer is the break timer. Once both timers are set you can then start them. This method of working follows the _Pomodoro Technique_.

## Motivations

I am always working on some project and I tend to overwork myself. I have gotten burnt out and was not healthy for me. To solve that issue I started using the _Pomodoro Technique_ which was helpful. The issue I ran into then was setting the timers. Every time it would change from working to taking a break I would have to go into the clock app and change it. I decided then why not program up something to allow me to consecutively and repeatedly run these timers and let me know when to take a break and when to get back to work? That led to what we have now Task:Timer.

## üöÄ Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> You will need the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to use Task:Timer

> More info on how to use Task:Timer found below

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Input Fields

In Task:Timer you have 4 necessary fields and 1 optional field to fill out.

#### Work Timer Controls

There are 2 fields to put in the amount of time for the Work Timer. You have `Hours` and `Minutes`. You need to at least enter one value in either one of these fields. An example is `Hours`:`25` or `1`:`Minutes`.

#### Break Timer Controls

It is pretty much the same as Work Timer Controls. There are 2 fields, `Hours`:`Minutes`. You need to at least enter one value into either or. An example is `Hours`:`5` or `1`:`Minutes`.

> [!TIP]
> For the most effective results for the _Pomodoro Technique_ it is better to have the break time be less than the work time.

#### Repeat Count (Optional)

In this field, you can enter how many times you want the timer set to repeat. So if you are planning on working for a while and dont want to reset and start the timer set again this is the way to go.

### Buttons

#### Start Button

This button will start the timer for you once the necessary requirements are met.

#### Reset Button

This button will reset all the fields to be blank.

#### Pause Button

This button allows you to pause the timer and unpause it.

> [!WARNING]
> This button can be a little bit wack at times. It is a known issue and is planned to be fixed down the line.

#### Stop Button

This Button will stop the timer completely.
